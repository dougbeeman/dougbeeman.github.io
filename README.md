====================
## Hello World!

This is my first try at github (actually, I tinkered and flailed a bit at a NICAR session)

My Github user page is at:
https://github.com/dougbeeman

My Github Pages repo can be found at:
https://github.com/dougbeeman/dougbeeman.github.io

And soon (I hope), you can see my customized homepage at:

https://dougbeeman.github.io

(Many thanks to Dan Nguyen for the walk-through on how to do this!)
